# Overview {-}

Description 
----------------------------

In this workshop, participants will learn about projected coordinate reference systems (CRS, commonly called “projections”) and how to apply them in R to spatial data. We will discuss the components of a CRS, how to apply them, how to translate your data into a different CRS, and how to choose a CRS.

Learning Objectives
----------------------------

By the end of this workshop, participants will have a better understanding of what a projected coordinate system is, why you would choose one over another, and how to apply them correctly to geospatial data in R.

Prerequisites
----------------------------

Participants should have a basic understanding of R (for example, be able to create variables and load common data formats like a CSV) and a basic understanding of GIS data formats (e.g., raster and vector data). Participants should also install R and RStudio.
